### Solution Title*
_Har App (A solution to online violence against women)_

### Solution Description*
_Har App was created to help tackle online violence against women.  Our solution addresses Problem statement 6 - Managing harassment. And it focuses on the three phases a victim might go through (before, during and after). 
Before the harassment: Our app educates women on how to avoid being victims online
During the harassment: We help women get the necessary help they need to deal with the situation.
After the harassment: We help connect women to relevant bodies for assistance._ 

### Solution Limitations
_The app only educates users on how to tackle online violence but does not perform the action for the users.
In future, we might come up with ways to actively perform the action for the users._
